What is the Language Learning App?

The Language Learning App is a web and mobile-friendly platform where users can learn new languages at their own pace. It offers tailored learning paths based on the user’s proficiency, provides interactive exercises, and tracks your progress over time.
Key Features

    Tailored Learning Paths: Upon registering, you will be asked to select your current language level. The system will then adapt the content to your real skill level by embedding challenges and tests within exercises.

    Hidden Adaptive Exams: Throughout your learning journey, the app will discreetly assess your proficiency by giving you slightly more difficult questions mixed into your normal exercises. It uses these to accurately adjust your level as you progress.

    Extra Credit Challenges: You can take on additional challenges for extra credit. These more difficult questions serve as the true exam to measure your skill.

    Unlocking New Content: As you progress and earn credits through completing exercises, you can unlock advanced lessons, new challenges, and special practice tools.

    Voice Rooms and Group Chats: Engage with other learners or native speakers in voice rooms and group chats, where you can practice your language skills in real-time.

How It Works

    Registration and Initial Setup: After registering, you'll be asked about your current language proficiency level. The system will use this as a starting point, but it will subtly assess your actual level during your exercises.

    Learning and Testing: As you complete exercises, hidden tests will help the app understand your real skill level. If your actual level differs from what you stated, the app will gradually adjust without you noticing.

    Progressive Difficulty: Exercises will get progressively harder or easier depending on your performance, ensuring that you’re always learning at the right level.

    Earn Credits: As you complete exercises and challenges, you will earn credits. These credits can be used to unlock advanced features or extend your time in voice rooms and group chats.

    Access to Voice Rooms: Once you reach a certain level, you will unlock the ability to enter voice rooms where you can speak with other learners or even native speakers.

Unlockable Features

    Advanced Lessons: Unlock more complex lessons to deepen your language skills.

    Extra Practice Tools: Access flashcards, quizzes, and grammar tools that provide more specific help on challenging topics.

    Detailed Feedback: You can unlock detailed feedback on your exercises using credits or by paying for premium services.

    Voice Rooms and Group Chats: Join voice rooms to practice speaking with others or participate in group chats about language learning tips and cultural insights.

Progress Tracking

    Milestones: Track your achievements through visual milestones displayed in your profile, showing how far you’ve come.

    Visual Progress: Access a visual representation of your progress, including your score and overall level.

    Real-Time Updates: Your learning path adjusts based on your performance in real time.

Community and Interaction

    Voice Rooms: Engage in live conversations with learners and native speakers, using credits to extend your participation time.

    Tutoring: Become a tutor or find one to help you with one-on-one learning sessions. Tutors can earn money by scheduling lessons with learners who need extra help.

    Group Chats: Join or create group chats with other learners to discuss topics or practice conversational skills.
